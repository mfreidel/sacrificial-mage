# Testbed Assets

All game assets are currently held in the project folder (on Google Drive).


Steps from Discord:

1. In the pj16 channel, view pinned messages.
2. Click the Google Drive link
3. Enter the **assets** folder.
4. Right-click on sprites and select download. Be patient. It may seem like it didn't work at first.
5. When it's done downloading, move the zip file here (the assets folder of the repo)
6. Right-click the zip and select "Extract here"
7. You should see a new folder called **sprites**
8. Delete the zip.


Make sure to upload any new assets ***and*** their `.import` files into
Google Drive. 

Make sure to discuss changes to existing files before even making 
them. Additionally, announce these changes before you upload them.
Drive has a method of revision control, but it's not fun to deal with.
